    <h3 class="subH1">Description</h3>
    <p>
        Sweet lassi is the perfect summer drink that comes together in less than five minutes.
        Plain lassi is easy to forget but every time I have it, I am reminded
        of how satisfying it is during a hot day. While most people outside South Asia only know mango lassi, I grew up with
        plain yogurt lassi. It’s lighter, serving as an actual refreshment rather than a dessert. The recipe I share here is
        my mother’s who is Punjabi with roots in Ludhiana in eastern Punjab
