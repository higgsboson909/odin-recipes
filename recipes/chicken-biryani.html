    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's
        typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties,
        or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth 
        it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
